    <h1>Project 0: Becoming Friends with Your Camera</h1>
    <h2>Part I: Selfie: The Wrong Way vs. The Right Way</h2>
    <p>
        In this part, I took pictures of my face at different distances from the camera. Below are the result of my photos:
    </p>
    <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; gap: 0px;">
        <figure>
            <img src="images/part1_1.png" alt="closest" width="250">
            <figcaption>closest</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <figure>
            <img src="images/part1_2.png" alt="second" width="250">
        </figure>

        <figure>
            <img src="images/part1_3.png" alt="third" width="250">
        </figure>

        <figure>
            <img src="images/part1_4.png" alt="furthest" width="250">
            <figcaption>furthest</figcaption>
        </figure>
    </div>
    <p>
        When the phone is closer to my face, my face looks more distorted as my nose and the middle of my face looks bigger.
        This is because the distance of the center of my face is closer to the camera than the rest of my face.
        When the phone is further, my face looks more compressed and natural as the features appear more flat.
        This is because the distance of different parts of my face are more similar to each other.
    </p>

    <h2>Part II: Architectural Perspective Compression</h2>
    <p>
        In this part, I took pictures of a house (not my house) from different distances. Below are the result of my photos:
    </p>
    <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; gap: 0px;">
        <figure>
            <img src="images/part2_1.png" alt="closest" width="250">
            <figcaption>closest</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <figure>
            <img src="images/part2_2.png" alt="second" width="250">
        </figure>

        <figure>
            <img src="images/part2_3.png" alt="third" width="250">
        </figure>

        <figure>
            <img src="images/part2_4.png" alt="furthest" width="250">
            <figcaption>furthest</figcaption>
        </figure>
    </div>
    <p>
        Similar to Part I, when the phone is further from the house, the house looks more flattened and normal.
        This is because the distance of the different parts of the house from the camera are more similar to each other.
        When the phone is closer, the house looks more distorted as the bottom of the house is closer and looks bigger compared to the top of the house, which is further.
    </p>

    <h2>Part III: The Dolly Zoom</h2>
    <p>
        In this part, I took 8 photos of my stuffed elephant and combined it into a gif. Below is the gif:
